This repository contains a version of the Hadoop 2.8.1 source code patched to
implement the replication policy as described in Yuhau Lin and Haiyang Shen,
"[EAFR: An Energy-Efficient Adaptive File Replication System in Data-Intensive Clusters](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7288402/)" in HDFS.

The git history in this repository can be extracted to construct a diff, which
it should be possible to apply to a more recent version of Hadoop HDFS.

See `README.EAFR.md` for more details about the patch and how to set it
up.

See `README.txt` for the README from the original Hadoop source repository.
